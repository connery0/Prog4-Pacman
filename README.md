# Controls
The game supports 1 or 2 players
First player can control their character with **WASD** or a controller.  
The second player can use **IJKL** or a controller.  
			There is currently only support for one controller
 
 The second player can be either ms. Pacman or control a ghost
 
 Selecting a level and choosing how to play is done by mouse.
 You need to select a level and how and if the second player is joining before pressing start
